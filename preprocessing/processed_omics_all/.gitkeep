# Processed all-patient omics data directory
# 
# This directory should contain the intermediate processed omics datasets
# for all patients (before filtering to 120 dual-timepoint patients).
# Due to file size constraints, these files are not included in the git repository.
# 
# Source data files (to be placed here):
# - improved_metabolomics_data.csv
# - improved_proteomics_data.csv  
# - datablock_pro.tsv (single-cell protein data)
# 
# These are intermediate files used by the filtering scripts to generate
# the final 120-patient datasets in processed_omics_120/
