# Processed 120-Patient Omics Data

This directory contains the final processed omics datasets for 120 dual-timepoint patients, ready for DIVAS multi-omics integration analysis.

## Data Files

The following files are generated by the preprocessing pipeline:

- **`sc_gex_120patients_aligned.csv`**: Single-cell gene expression data (aligned)
- **`proteomics_120patients.csv`**: Bulk proteomics data  
- **`metabolomics_120patients.csv`**: Bulk metabolomics data
- **`sc_pro_120patients.csv`**: Single-cell protein expression data (CLR normalized)

## Data Verification (Optional)

### verify_final_alignment.py

**Purpose**: Verifies that sample order is identical across all omics data files.

**Usage**:
```bash
cd preprocessing/processed_omics_120
python verify_final_alignment.py
```

**Expected Output**:
```
Success: All files have identical sample order
```

**Note**: This verification step is **optional** for the provided datasets, as they have been pre-aligned during preprocessing. However, **sample alignment is critical for DIVAS analysis** - if you modify or replace any data files, ensure that sample order is identical across all omics blocks before running DIVAS integration.

## Data Format

All files follow the same format:
- **First column**: `Feature` (gene/protein/metabolite IDs)
- **Remaining columns**: Sample data in `COVID_X_TX` format (e.g., `COVID_1_T1`, `COVID_1_T2`)
- **Sample count**: 240 samples (120 patients × 2 timepoints)

## Next Steps

The provided datasets are ready for DIVAS analysis:
- **4-Omics Integration**: `../multi_omics_integration/run_divas_analysis.R`
- **Cell Type Analysis**: `../scRNA_celltyist_analysis/`

⚠️ **Important**: If you modify any data files, always ensure sample order consistency across all omics blocks. DIVAS requires identical sample ordering for proper multi-omics integration.
