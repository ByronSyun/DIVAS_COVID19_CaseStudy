# Processed 120-patient omics data directory
# 
# This directory should contain the final filtered omics datasets for 120 patients
# who have both T1 and T2 timepoint data.
# Due to file size constraints, these files are not included in the git repository.
# 
# To generate the data:
# Run the filtering scripts in the respective preprocessing directories:
# - process_bulk/filter_metabolomics_for_120patients.py
# - process_bulk/filter_proteomics_for_120patients.py  
# - process_sc/sc_pro_processing/filter_sc_pro_for_120patients.py
# - process_sc/sc_gex_processing/filter_sc_gex_for_120patients.py
# 
# Expected files:
# - metabolomics_120patients.csv
# - proteomics_120patients.csv
# - sc_pro_120patients.csv (CLR normalized)
# - sc_gex_120patients_aligned.csv
# 
# These files are used for 4-omics DIVAS integration analysis.
