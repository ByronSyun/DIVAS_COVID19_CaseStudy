# Processed scRNA-seq GEX data directory
# 
# This directory should contain processed single-cell gene expression data.
# Due to file size constraints, these files are not included in the git repository.
# 
# To generate the data:
# Run the GEX processing pipeline: python3 process_gex_data.py
# 
# Expected files:
# - Individual sample .h5ad files after quality control and normalization
# - Aggregated expression matrices
# 
# Note: This data is required for downstream CellTypist annotation
